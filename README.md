# 🛡️ CRSLang

> **Transform OWASP CRS rules into a modern, abstract representation** 🚀

The code in this repository aims to generate a new representation for the OWASP CRS rules, making them more accessible and maintainable.

## 🤔 Why CRSLang?

The goal is to abstract OWASP CRS from the specifics of the Seclang language in which it is currently written. This abstraction provides:

- 🔄 **Better maintainability** - Easier to understand and modify rules
- 🎯 **Language independence** - Not tied to Seclang syntax
- 🚀 **Enhanced tooling** - Better support for analysis and transformation
- 📊 **Improved readability** - Cleaner representation of security rules

## ✨ Features

- 🔧 **Extended ANTLR Listener** - Extends the listener generated by the ANTLR Seclang parser
- 📝 **Complete Rule Loading** - Loads Seclang rule information stored in the CRS files, including comments
- 🎨 **New Representation** - Defines a new representation for the rules and translates them into it
- 🔄 **Bidirectional Conversion** - Convert between Seclang and CRSLang formats

## 🚀 Quick Start

### 📥 Installation

Initialize the repo:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/coreruleset/crslang.git
cd crslang
```

### 🔨 Build

Generate the ANTLR parser code and build the project:

```bash
go build
```

## 💻 Usage

### 🔄 Convert Seclang to CRSLang

Load and translate the Seclang OWASP CRS files to the new representation:

```bash
./crslang -o crs seclang_parser/testdata/crs
```

### 🔄 Convert CRSLang back to Seclang

Load and translate the CRSLang back to Seclang:

```bash
./crslang -s crs.yaml
```

### 🧪 Testing

Run the tests to ensure everything works correctly:

```bash
go test -v
```
