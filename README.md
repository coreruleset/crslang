# CRSLang

The code in this repository aims to generate a new representation for the OWASP CRS rules.

## Why?

The goal is to abstract OWASP CRS from the specifics of the Seclang language in which it is currently written.

## Features

- Extends the listener generated by the ANTLR Seclang parser.
- Loads Seclang rule information stored in the CRS files, including comments.
- Defines a new representation for the rules and translates them into it.

## Install?

Initialize the repo and its submodule:

```bash
git clone --recurse-submodules https://gitlab.fing.edu.uy/gsi/seclang/crslang.git
```

## Usage

Generate the ANTLR parser code:

```bash
go run mage.go generate
```

Load and translate to the new representation:
(In progress, paths are hardcoded)

```bash
go run main.go -i <input_file> -o <output_file>
```
